You were on your way out in Bank then Shoreditch wearing office attire. You walked me out and I really wanted to ask for your number but my date was there - awkward!!!! Hope youâ€™re out there and single!!!",

Was going to strike up a conversation when we sat down but then the lady nearby asked you about your instrument. Doh. I was wearing blue trousers and a cardigan and listening to radio through my phone. I felt a connection with you - would love to meet properly for a drink or coffee!",
