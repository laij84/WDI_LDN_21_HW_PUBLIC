  description: "I am Liz - the girl who looked very lost at Bank tube on my way to a first date. I was wearing a blue shirt dress and cream heels. I was just back from living in Nigeria. You were on your way out in Bank then Shoreditch wearing office attire. You walked me out and I really wanted to ask for your number but my date was there - awkward!!!! Hope youâ€™re out there and single!!!"
