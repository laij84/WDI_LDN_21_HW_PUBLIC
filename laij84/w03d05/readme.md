# Express Multi-Page

Using everything you have learnt so far about Express, your weekend task is to put everything into practise and make a multi-page node app.

You can make anything you want? Perhaps make a site for a friend's business?

> **Note:** Remember, developers (like yourselves) charge money for work like this!

## Deliverable

- The website should have a number of pages
- The website be styled with CSS
- The website should contain some images
- The website should be responsive
- You could include vanilla JS or jQuery
- Perhaps add some animation or a library like Animate CSS
