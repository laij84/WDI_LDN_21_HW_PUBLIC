# Express Random

## Introduction

Now that you have had a brief introduction to making some basic routes with ExpressJS, it's time to put that knowledge into practise... and make something random!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

You need to make an app with at least two pages:

- Home
- About

##### Home

On the home page, you need to generate something random. This could be a phrase, an image, a quote - it's up to you.

Think how you might achieve this. You don't need to use anything that you haven't seen before to solve this propblem (no database required!) You can achieve this with pure javascript.

##### About

A brief about page explaining what your home page is doing.

##### Practising npm

You also need to install a new npm package called `express-ejs-layouts`. You need to google this and implement this yourselves. 

## Bonus:

- Perhaps you could change the page styling when something random is generated?

#### Starter code

There is no starter-code for this homework, so read over your notes carefully and take things slowly.
