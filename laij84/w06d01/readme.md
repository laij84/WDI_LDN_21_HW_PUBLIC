# Homework - Countries App 

- Create an app to store information about the countries 
- Each country needs a name, an image of its flag (the image has to be displayed), a size (how many square miles of surface), a population, a first language, maybe more (currency, GDP in $bn, etc.)
- Your homework *must* include some feature/helper of Rails we have not covered in class (we're doing Associations and View Partials tomorrow...so no points for that ;-) - something in Models, ActiveRecord queries, View Helpers, Migrations, Controller actions
- Use the Ruby skills we've covered so far to best effect - DRY; clear code; conventions; enumerators.

Bonus: Language is a separate model and countries have an association with it.

Bonus Bonus: Your app have a model continent, on continent#show page, we can see a list of all countries in this continent , in countries#new, there is a dropdown to select the cotinent related to this country.
