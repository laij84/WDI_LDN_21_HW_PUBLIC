# Yearbook API

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Your task is to create an API for a WDI yearbook. This API will have no front-end but will render JSON so that we might consume it later.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an express API that has one model, `User`

The User model should have these fields:

- name
- twitter (String link to twitter profile)
- github (String link to Github)
- image (String)
- bio (String)
- portfolio (String for website)

The API should have RESTful routes.

**Note:** You must output the correct JSON.

#### Starter code

There is no starter-code.
